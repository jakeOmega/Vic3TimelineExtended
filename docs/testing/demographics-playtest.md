# Demographics play-test checklist

What the next play-test of the Demographics rule should look at. Since 2026-10-12 the owner's in-game checks no
longer gate a merge: a PR lands on the offline gate (CI, the audits, the golden tests, the harness), adds what only
the game can show here, and the play-test before a release works through the list. Where a build rests on an engine
fact nobody has verified, it ships the preferred version with a self-check line in `debug.log` and names its fallback
below; a BROKEN line means swap the fallback in.

Each PR adds its own section, newest last, and a fixed item is struck through with the commit that fixed it.

## How to run

- **Deploy** per CLAUDE.md, "Play-testing unmerged work" (or from `main`). Check the playset has no Workshop copy of
  the mod.
- **Rule.** The Demographics (Experimental) rule is chosen in the lobby: Disabled (the default, and every release),
  Display only, or Full. Each item names its setting.
- **Console.** Vic3's console has no `effect` command: the census's console is `event te_debug_demog.1`, on the
  player's country, with lettered options (the list is at the top of `events/te_debug_demog_events.txt`).
- **Logs.** Read `debug.log`, not `error.log`. Grep it for `TE_SELF_CHECK` first, then `TE_DEMOG`.

## Self-checks (every game, any rule)

| Line in `debug.log` | When | OK means | BROKEN means | Fallback |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `TE_SELF_CHECK … primogeniture_scaled` | once a game: `START` when the first state with a farm share between 0.1 and 0.9 takes Primogeniture's farm line fresh (a Primogeniture country's first yearly state pulse), the verdict a week later | the engine sums a script-only type on a state modifier scaled by its multiplier (`added` ≈ `expected`) | `added` reads 0.1 (the multiplier is ignored) or 0 (the type isn't summed): Primogeniture's farm births are wrong in every game | Plan B of `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-11-demographics-late-marriage.md`, Task 9 |

No `TE_SELF_CHECK` line at all after a game's first year means no state took the line fresh: no country had Primogeniture, or the game was continued from a save where every Primogeniture state already held it. Start a new game, or enact the law. A `START` with no verdict means the state changed hands within the week; the check doesn't run again in that game.

## Late Marriage and Birth Spacing (#906)

1. **Full, a new 1836 game as Britain.**
   - The Population panel's children-per-woman tooltip shows "Late marriage ×0.90" and "women marry at about 26",
     with "Birth spacing ×1.00". The country line reads about 26 and 0%.
   - A Japanese state's Demographics subtab: Birth spacing ×0.80, Late marriage ×1.00, women marry at about 19.
   - A Chinese state: Birth spacing ×0.99.
   - A state in Posen: Late marriage ×0.92 (a share of 0.8), women marry at about 25.
2. **Option l** on the capital after its first census step: `lm=1.000`, `bs=0.000`, `lm_target` near 1 (an
   unincorporated state reads `lm_target=-1.000`), and
   `absorbed_b` holding 0.1 × the capital's agrarian share on top of the laws' own absorbed birth lines.
3. **Disabled, a new game, a farming state in Britain** (Primogeniture). After its first yearly pulse, its birth-rate
   breakdown shows Primogeniture's farm births at +10% × its Peasants' and Farmers' share, as a Laws and Institutions
   line, and no "Cadet Sons Leave the Land" birth line. The modifier still shows its migration line. (The self-check
   above tests the same thing from the log.)
4. **Full, the same state after its first census step:** no Laws and Institutions birth line, Census: Births present,
   and option n's `q_b` at 0.
5. **A split state.** Release or annex part of a state region (debug). At its next census the new state's option l
   shows its sibling's `lm` and `bs`, not the start table's.
6. **A whole state region changing hands** (a debug transfer, or a revolution that wins). At the new state's first
   census, option l shows the old state's last `lm` and `bs` (the region's copy). Option q answers whether
   `on_state_owner_change` still sees the old state's variables: if it does, a follow-up can carry the census's ring
   and medicine through conquests too.
7. **An old save** made under Full before this build: each state's tooltip shows ×1.00 for both practices until its
   next yearly pulse, then its seed.
8. **Fast mode** (option h) for a few clock years: the capital's `lm` moves once a clock year, toward `lm_target`.
9. **`debug.log`:** no error from `te_demog_practice_effects.txt`, the generated `te_demog_pr_*` values, `region =
   sr:` or `state_region = s:` lookups ("Invalid strategic region"), or `te_demog_events.4` fired from the rural
   refresh.
10. **Two yearly plain-text saves of the Full game:** keep them. The harness's `practices-check` (not built yet; the
    late-marriage plan, Task 12 Step 2) compares each state's stepped shares with the model's.
11. Optional, for phase 3: does `every_neighbouring_state` from a British state include a French one?

## Medical Outreach (#929)

1. **Full.** Issue Medical Outreach in a state behind its medicine targets. Once the state has caught up, the decree
   ends on its own; the decree panel names the reason as "This state's medicine is still behind what our technology
   and laws allow", not a raw comparison.
2. **Full, an observer run of a few decades:** AI countries issue it in states behind and let it lapse; few states
   hold it once caught up.
