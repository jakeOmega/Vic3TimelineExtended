### Pop Growth Constants
## Base Values per month
@min_birthrate = 0.00080  			# Minimum base birthrate per month (at POP_GROWTH_STABLE_SOL)
@max_birthrate = 0.00450			# Maximum base birthrate per month (at SOL = 0 if not modified by malnourishment)
@min_mortality = 0.00100			# Minimum base mortality per month (at POP_GROWTH_STABLE_SOL)
@max_mortality = 0.00600			# Maximum base mortality per month (at SOL = 0 if not modified by malnourishment)

## SoL Thresholds
@pop_growth_equilibrium_sol = 5		# Equilibrium is pops stop starving and where growth first becomes positive
@pop_growth_transition_sol = 10     # Transition determines how long birthrate "lags" behind mortality before starting to drop. Setting to same as equilibrium leads to no "lag" (only matters for birthrate)
@pop_growth_max_sol = 12			# Growth Max is where net growth generally is at it's highest (only matters for mortality)
@pop_growth_stable_sol = 35			# Stable is where birthrate and mortality stop changing and hit their minimum values

## Others
@transition_birthrate_mult = 1 		# If you want the birthrate "lag" to go to a higher or lower value than max_birthrate. (you can also just change it directly below)
@max_growth_mortality_mult = 0.5	# What proportion of birthrate_at_growth_max mortality should be at. Higher means lower growth

### Pop Growth Derived values
# Generally, for each one of these derived values below we're really just doing one of three operations (or combination of them):
# - Calculate a Point: sol * slope + start_value   					(x_at_y)
# - Calculate a Slope: (start_value - end_value) / number_of_steps	(x_slope)
# - Calculate an Intercept: -slope*sol + end_value					(x_intercept)
# Intercepts are only needed for line segments that don't start at 0 SoL
